# DST1-ForestFireAQI
### Analysis of EPA's AQI data in relation to Colorado forest fires

 by Alex Valone, Adam Fitzsimmons, Lin Ma

#### Research Questions: 
- Visualize patterns of air quality over time, 2019 – 2024 

- Identify the patterns of changes in daily air quality by pollutant
   + Two most significant pollutants: Ozone and PM2.5

- Compare values of air quality index (AQI) 
  + By year 
  + By season

- Visualize patterns of air quality during wildfire events
  + Investigate the impact of wildfires on the air quality in Colorado



Datasets: 
1. The AQI data from AirNow provided by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
2. The wildfire data from VIIRS provided by NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS)


About the folders:
1. data: Include the downloaded data files – AQI and wildfires and the analysis data files
2. notebooks: the Jupyter Notebook files for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis
3. src: The python scripts and the json scripts for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data analysis
4. visuals: All visual maps and analysis outputs


Main Findings: 
- PM2.5 is more sensitive to fire events than Ozone, likely better feature
- AQI followed seasonal trends of being higher in the summer than winter
